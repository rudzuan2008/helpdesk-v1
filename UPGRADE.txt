You have to:

1) Do a safety backup of the original database and of the attachments directory.
2) Make sure you have done a good backup of the original database and of the attachments directory :).
3) Delete all the files BUT the attachment directory of the installed version.
4) Upload on the server all the file of the Katak-support system.
5) Start a normal installation, but select the tab Upgrade and follow the instructions.
6) Enter as administrator and check the system configuration.

Note: If you database is big, be sure to have enough time and memory to run the PHP upgrade script!

Note3: There could be problems doing the upgrade with messages written in non-Latin characters (eg Cyrillic)
